# Tube_Amplifier_Simulations
This repository will host utilities, written in a variety of languages, to aid in the development of vacuum tube amplifier circuits. 

# Software included in the MATLAB file:
- Speaker_Impedance_TubeAmp.m
  - A script that generates recommended speaker impedance given appropriate information about the power tube and output amplifier.
  - Similar to the equivalent .asm file, but more comprehensive. This version will generate a text output, "Recommended: n Ohm speaker" based on a switching inequality function. Will also indicate if the impedance does not closely match a common speaker impedance.

# Software included in the R file:
- NONE yet!

# Software included in the MIPS file:
- Speaker_Impedance_TubeAmp.asm
  - A script that generates recommended speaker impedance given appropriate information about the power tube and output amplifier.
  - Similar to equivalent .m file, but less comprehensive.
